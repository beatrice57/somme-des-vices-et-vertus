This repository contains material relating to two manuscripts of the
medieval French text *Somme des vices et vertus*
(<https://ling.upenn.edu/~beatrice/corpus-ling/french-corpora-sources/penn_sources_contents.html#somme-royal-penn>),
the Royal ms. and the Cotton ms.

The Royal manuscript is the text underlying the parsed sample (Tysor
1949, lines 1-2407, pp. 1-85) in the Penn-BFM Parsed Corpus of
Historical French <https://github.com/beatrice57/mcvf-plus-ppchf>.
The Royal directory contains:

- the entire raw text in Tysor 1949 (lines 1-3497, pp. 1-124) and Allen
  1951 (lines 3498-7257, pp. 1-173)
- an uncorrected draft parse of Tysor 1949, lines 2408-3000, pp. 85-106
  (7,223 words, starting where the PPPCHF sample ends, but not
  continuing to the end of Tysor 1949)

The Cotton manuscript is likely the basis for the translation of the
Somme into Middle English that goes by the name of *Ayenbite of Inwyt*,
which is included in the Penn-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English,
second edition
<https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/PPCME2-RELEASE-4/index.html>.
The Cotton directory contains:

- page images of the manuscript supplied by Suzanne Evans Wagner
- transcripts produced from those images by Beatrice Santorini
- a parsed sample of the Cotton ms. corresponding to lines 838-946,
  tokens 1,30.823-1,34.927 of the PPCHF sample based on the Royal ms.)

The text encoding throughout is UTF-8.
